README for Direction(Motion) Identifier:

1. This code determines the direction of motion from the Frobenius norms of the optical flow vectors from each frame.

2. This code then makes a video printing the direction of motion from the Frobenius norm on the video itself. Sample output frames and videos are provided. 

3. horizontal_flap folder is for stabilized optical flow, while horizontal_raw does the same for the raw video.
